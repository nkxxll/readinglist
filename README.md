A personal web application built with Elixir and Phoenix, designed to help you curate and manage your reading list.

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

To start your Phoenix server:

*   Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
*   Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
*   Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install --prefix assets`
*   Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes / Ideas / Todo

- the readinglist is a kind of interactive website currently it is only implemented using simple
html methods and no custom js
- the problem is that the updates for hidden and read toggles are slow because the whole site is
fetched again
- this would be a use for live view I might make a live view version of this site (todo)
